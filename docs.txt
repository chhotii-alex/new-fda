Local Database Strategy

Local to the PC there are a number of docker containers running Postgres servers.
This project will save data to ONE of these, the one named newfda.
Within the newfda Postres server instance there is a database named dataset.
The dataset database contains TWO user-data schemas:
- secret - any PHI
- public - de-identified data

User "postgres" owns both these schemas and has full privileges. We can join across 
tables in the two schemas by qualifying the table names with the schema names like so:

select * from public.my_data d
  JOIN secret.lookup s on d.id = s.id

Do not use uppercase letters in Postgres names!!!! Argh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
